The 2017 Extreme Wildfires Events in Portugal through the Perceptions of Volunteer and Professional Firefighters,10.3390/fire6040133,Leone V.,"This study aimed to explore differences in the perceptions of professional and voluntary firefighters regarding the extreme wildfire events that occurred in Portugal in 2017. We collected a sample of 185 participants, professional and voluntary firefighters, who directly participated in suppression activities for the Pedrógão Grande and October 2017 wildfires in Portugal. They were on duty in 149 fire stations in the Central Region of Portugal. A questionnaire was sent via Google Form to participants, based mainly on close-ended and two open-ended questions. It was structured into topics concerning the characteristics of wildfire events, the problems that occurred during the suppression activity, the emotional response of participants to the events, the lessons learned, and the consequences. We found significant differences between the two groups in their perception of wildfire characteristics and their perception of the worst fires they had ever experienced. Some differences were found in their discussion of the suppression phase and their emotional response to fires. On the contrary, the two groups appear to be homogeneous when it comes to no significant changes after the deadly 2017 experience in terms of the fight against rural fires, organization, training, prevention, and careers. The results underline the inadequacy of the suppression model vs. extreme wildfire events, and also its limits from the point of view of psychological reactions and the perception of management problems occurring in extreme and complex events. There is a research gap and no examples in Portugal about the perception of firefighters of the complex flow of activities that characterize the suppression operation of extreme wildfire events. Our research fills this gap."
Multi-Indices Diagnosis of the Conditions That Led to the Two 2017 Major Wildfires in Portugal,10.3390/fire6020056,Andrade C.,"Forest fires, though part of a natural forest renewal process, when frequent and on a large -scale, have detrimental impacts on biodiversity, agroforestry systems, soil erosion, air, and water quality, infrastructures, and the economy. Portugal endures extreme forest fires, with a record extent of burned areas in 2017. These complexes of extreme wildfire events (CEWEs) concentrated in a few days but with highly burned areas are, among other factors, linked to severe fire weather conditions. In this study, a comparison between several fire danger indices (named ‘multi-indices diagnosis’) is performed for the control period 2001–2021, 2007 and 2017 (May–October) for the Fire Weather Index (FWI), Burning Index (BI), Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI), Continuous Haines Index (CHI), and the Keetch–Byram Drought Index (KBDI). Daily analysis for the so-called Pedrógão Grande wildfire (17 June) and the October major fires (15 October) included the Spread Component (SC), Ignition Component (IC), Initial Spread Index (ISI), Buildup Index (BUI), and the Energy Release Component (ERC). Results revealed statistically significant high above-average values for most of the indices for 2017 in comparison with 2001–2021, particularly for October. The spatial distribution of BI, IC, ERC, and SC had the best performance in capturing the locations of the two CEWEs that were driven by atmospheric instability along with a dry environment aloft. These results were confirmed by the hotspot analysis that showed statistically significant intense spatial clustering between these indices and the burned areas. The spatial patterns for SC and ISI showed high values associated with high velocities in the spread of these fires. The outcomes allowed us to conclude that since fire danger depends on several factors, a multi-indices diagnosis can be highly relevant. The implementation of a Multi-index Prediction Methodology should be able to further enhance the ability to track and forecast unique CEWEs since the shortcomings of some indices are compensated by the information retrieved by others, as shown in this study. Overall, a new forecast method can help ensure the development of appropriate spatial preparedness plans, proactive responses by civil protection regarding firefighter management, and suppression efforts to minimize the detrimental impacts of wildfires in Portugal."
Field and laboratory analysis of the junction fire process in the catastrophic fire of Pedrógão Grande in June 2017,10.1071/WF22161,Viegas D.X.,"Background: Two fire ignitions in Pedrógão Grande on 7 June 2017 had very fast due to unusual physical processes associated with the interaction between an overhead thunderstorm and the fire and the subsequent merging of the fires as a junction fire, killing 66 persons in 2 h. Aims: Using a laboratory simulation of the merging process, we explain the fire spread conditions and verify that the junction of the two fires was responsible for the very intense fire development. Methods: The real fire spread was reconstructed from an extensive field survey and physical modelling tests were performed in the Fire Research Laboratory combustion tunnel using various fuels and scale modelling laws. Key results: The spread and merging of the two fires in the tests agree very well with field observations, namely the periods of rate of spread (ROS) increase and decrease, peak values of ROS and area growth process using scaling laws. Conclusions: Analysis of the Pedrógão Grande fire evolution and its physical simulation at laboratory scale showed the importance of the mechanisms of two fires merging in producing very important convective processes. Implications: Our study showed the validity of performing the experimental analysis of complex fire spread situations provided that the similarity conditions are fulfilled."
Myopia during emergency improvisation: lessons from a catastrophic wildfire,10.1108/MD-03-2021-0378,Cunha M.P.,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how a number of processes joined to create the microlevel strategies and procedures that resulted in the most lethal and tragic forest fire in Portugal's history, recalled as the EN236-1 road tragedy in the fire of Pedrógão Grande. Design/methodology/approach: Using an inductive theory development approach, the authors consider how the urgency and scale of perceived danger coupled with failures of system-wide communication led fire teams to improvise repeatedly. Findings: The paper shows how structure collapse led teams to use only local information prompting acts of improvisational myopia, in the particular shape of corrosive myopia, and how a form of incidental improvisation led to catastrophic results. Practical implications: The research offers insights into the dangers of improvisation arising from corrosive myopia, identifying ways to minimize them with the development of improvisation practices that allow for the creation of new patterns of action. The implications for managing surprise through improvisation extend to risk contexts beyond wildfires. Originality/value: The paper stands out for showing the impact of improvisational myopia, especially in its corrosive form, which stands in stark contrast to the central role of attention to the local context highlighted in previous research on improvisation. At the same time, by exploring the effects of incidental improvisation, it also departs from the agentic conception of improvisation widely discussed in the improvisation literature."
Influence of Convectively Driven Flows in the Course of a Large Fire in Portugal: The Case of Pedrógão Grande,10.3390/atmos13030414,Pinto P.,"The influence of a mesoscale convective system (MCS) in the evolution of two wildfires that started during the afternoon of 17 June 2017 in Pedrógão Grande, Central Portugal is discussed and analysed using weather radar data, weather stations, video images and fire spread analysis. As the MCS approached the region, its convectively driven flows started to influence the fires. The overturning flows were formed by two main limbs: one organised as front-to-rear deep layer inflows that propagated over the convective region of the MCS and the other as rear-to-front mid-level inflows that descended below the anvil structure of the MCS. The rear-to-front inflows, while accelerating and descending to lower levels, contributed to modify the fires’ intensity and plume characteristics. After the two fires merged, the resulting junction fire became very intense and impossible to control. Then, a firestorm was generated, causing the deaths of 66 people. The main goal of this study is to detail the influence of the MCS in the fire spread, thus contributing to the general knowledge of outstanding fire behaviour modifications due to the influence of atmospheric convective processes."
Sub-Hourly Precipitation Extremes in Mainland Portugal and Their Driving Mechanisms,10.3390/cli10020028,Santos J.A.,"Sub-hourly heavy precipitation events (SHHPs) frequently underlie major meteorological hazards, but their comprehensive analysis is still lacking in Portugal. A 71-weather-station dataset for 2000–2020 is used in this article to (1) diagnose SHHPs corresponding to a 10-min precipitation event of at least 5.0 mm, (2) characterize their spatial-temporal distribution, and (3) identify their associated synoptic-scale conditions. Two synoptic types are associated with SHHPs: remote (RemL) and regional (RegL) low-pressure systems. RegL SHHPs display two marked maxima in spring and autumn, while RemL SHHPs show a single maximum in autumn. Most RegL events occur in the afternoon/evening, while RemL events show a slight bias toward midday occurrences. In the case of RemL, the wind is stronger for 2 to 3 h before and during SHHPs, veers from 180◦ to 210◦ near the event, the pressure decreases until 20 min before the event, and the wet-bulb temperature decreases around the time of the event and remains low, thus reflecting cold-front passages. For RegL, maximum winds coincide with precipitation peaks, and the wet-bulb temperature briefly decreases in association with downdrafts. A preliminary relationship between the SHHPs and mesoscale convective systems is established by detecting sudden surface-pressure surges, which are indicative of mesohighs caused by evaporatively cooled downdrafts. A calendar of mesohigh episodes linked to SHHPs is provided herein and their signatures are illustrated for the “Pedrógão-Grande” fires. Indicators of several downbursts, cold pools, and mesohighs were identified by the AROME forecast. This first, systematized analysis paves the way to identifying dynamic precursors, enabling their integration into early warning systems and climate projections."
The informative coverage of tragic events into television channels. A case study: the Pedrógão Grande fires in Portugal and the disappearance of Julén Roselló in Spain,10.15847/obsOBS15420211963,Ortiz S.L.,"Dramatic events, natural catastrophes and, in general, some tragic events that produce pain and suffering pose a huge challenge for journalism professionals, almost forced to provide information about what happened in a matter of minutes. This investigation examines what the work of journalists is at the scene, how they search for information, their relationship with rescue operations, witnesses, family members or the injured themselves. In addition, compliance with ethical and deontological precepts in this type of coverage is analyzed. For this, it investigates two events that have aroused great interest in the news in recent years. On the one hand, the agonizing rescue in 2019 of little Julen Roselló, a child who at just 9 years old lost his life after falling into a very narrow well in Totalán (Málaga). On the other hand, the news coverage of the worst wave of fires in Portugal, which caused 66 deaths and 254 injuries in the town of Pedrógão Grande, in June 2017. From a methodological point of view, the main study has been used the content analysis, creating a study sheet applied to the Spanish television networks TVE, Antena 3 and Telecinco, and to the Portuguese television networks RTP1, SIC and TVI, respectively. As conclusions of the investigation, it can be anticipated that the Spanish and Portuguese mass media devoted hundreds of hours to the informative coverage of the events taken as a case study, developing an informative coverage far from the principles of journalistic conciseness and objectivity that is so much needed. in circumstances where tragedy becomes the protagonist of the information."
The impact on structures of the pedrógão grande fire complex in June 2017 (Portugal),10.3390/fire3040057,Ribeiro L.M.,"On 17 June 2017, one of the most dramatic and destructive wildfires in Portugal’s History started, formed by a complex of at least five wildfires that merged together burning more than 45,000 hectares. In its aftermath, 66 persons lost their lives, most of them trying to run away from the fire, more than 250 were injured, and over 1000 structures (including 263 residential homes) were damaged or destroyed, with direct losses estimated at around 200 million euros. Shortly after the fire was extinguished, and as part of a larger analysis, the authors performed exhaustive field work to assess the fire impact on all manmade structures in the area of the Pedrógão Grande fire. A specific geodatabase was built, accounting for an extensive set of parameters aimed at characterizing: (i) The structure, (ii) the surroundings of the structure, and (iii) the arrival and impact of the fire. A total of 1043 structures were considered for the analysis, mostly support structures, like sheds or storage (38.6%), but also around 25% of dwellings (13.3% primary and 11.9% secondary). Regarding the ignitions, more than 60% of the structures were ignited due to the deposition of firebrands in different weak points. In addition, more than 60% of these ignitions occurred on the roofs, mainly because of the vulnerability associated with the structures and materials supporting them. Despite these results, and from what we observed on the structures that were not destroyed, we still consider that for the Portuguese reality houses are a good refuge, providing that they and their surroundings are managed and kept in good conditions."
Lightning modelling for the research of forest fire ignition in Portugal,10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.104993,Couto F.T.,"The study aims to assess the applicability of the current Meso-NH electrical scheme (CELLS) in the investigation of forest fire ignition. Therefore, the challenge is to diagnose cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning at 1 km spatial resolution and, subsequently, preferred regions where Forest Fire Events (FFE) could be naturally ignited. The afternoon of 17th June 2017 has been considered for the study, since the dry thunderstorm environment configured a perfect scenario for natural ignition and evolution of some fires. The Pedrógão Grande wildfire ignited in this period and was the deadliest single fire event in the Portuguese history, with at least 60 people killed. The available observational data are used to validate the numerical results and to provide a brief characterization of the meteorological environment when jointly analysed with the simulation. In addition, cloud microphysics and cloud electrical structure are explored from the model results. The spatial distribution of the simulated CG lightning showed a good agreement with the lightning strokes obtained from the national lightning detection network. Overall, this paper introduces a possible application of the Meso-NH electrical scheme, namely the study of forest fire ignition by lightning strokes."
When the sender is the message: the communication of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa about the 2017 fires,10.17231/comsoc.0(2020).2741,Toniolo B.P.,"The theme of this article is the official crisis communication of the Portuguese Presidency (Presidência da República Portuguesa – PRP) during the forest fires that occurred in June and in October 2017, respectively known as the “tragedy of Pedrógão Grande” and the “October fires”. The fires of 2017 were the most harmful in Portuguese history and received wide coverage in the international media. That year, Portugal was the country that most suffered with fires, according to an European Union report (2018), accounting for about 90% of deaths caused by this type of fire in the entire area covered by the report. The main theoretical basis of this study is situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) (Coombs, 2007). In SCCT, Coombs (2007) identified the variables involved in a crisis and presented the most appropriate response strategies to be applied to each crisis type. Through the discourse analysis method, we described and compared the Portuguese Presidency's communication on the management of these two crises of similar origins (forest fires), only four months apart (June and October 2017). Our aim is to contribute to an understanding of the response strategies proposed by Coombs (2007) when applied to communication exclusively based on the public information model (Grunig & Hunt, 1984). The research concluded that the PRP opted for the managing meaning strategy by adjusting information and predominance of the primary repair responses of the category “rebuild” and subcategory “compensation”, producing an appropriate response according to SCCT (Coombs, 2007). However, we note that the PRP crisis communication for the 2017 fires is a case in which the personal characteristics of the sender and the variables – crisis responsibility, crisis history and prior relationship reputation – were more relevant to the effectiveness of crisis communication than the messages themselves."
Tracing devastating fires in Portugal to a snow archive in the Swiss Alps: A case study,10.5194/tc-14-3731-2020,Osmont D.,"Recent large wildfires, such as those in Portugal in 2017, have devastating impacts on societies, economy, ecosystems and environments. However, wildfires are a natural phenomenon, which has been exacerbated by land use during the past millennia. Ice cores are one of the archives preserving information on fire occurrences over these timescales. A difficulty is that emission sensitivity of ice cores is often unknown, which constitutes a source of uncertainty in the interpretation of such archives. Information from specific and well-documented case studies is therefore useful to better understand the spatial representation of ice-core burning records. The wildfires near Pedrógão Grande in central Portugal in 2017 provided a test bed to link a fire event to its footprint left in a high-alpine snowpack considered a surrogate for high-alpine ice-core sites. Here, we (1) analysed black carbon (BC) and microscopic charcoal particles deposited in the snowpack close to the high-alpine research station Jungfraujoch in the Swiss Alps; (2) calculated backward trajectories based on ERA-Interim reanalysis data and simulated the transport of these carbonaceous particles using a global aerosol-climate model; and (3) analysed the fire spread, its spatial and temporal extent, and its intensity with remote-sensing (e.g. MODIS) Active Fire and Burned Area products. According to modelled emissions of the FINN v1.6 database, the fire emitted a total amount of 203.5 t BC from a total burned area of 501 km2 as observed on the basis of satellite fire products. Backward trajectories unambiguously linked a peak of atmospheric-equivalent BC observed at the Jungfraujoch research station on 22 June - with elevated levels until 25 June - with the highly intensive fires in Portugal. The atmospheric signal is in correspondence with an outstanding peak in microscopic charcoal observed in the snow layer, depositing nearly as many charcoal particles as during an average year in other ice archives. In contrast to charcoal, the amount of atmospheric BC deposited during the fire episode was minor due to a lack of precipitation. Simulations with a global aerosol-climate model suggest that the observed microscopic charcoal particles originated from the fires in Portugal and that their contribution to the BC signal in snow was negligible. Our study revealed that microscopic charcoal can be transported over long distances (1500 km) and that snow and ice archives are much more sensitive to distant events than sedimentary archives, for which the signal is dominated by local fires. The findings are important for future ice-core studies as they document that, for BC as a fire tracer, the signal preservation depends on precipitation. Single events, like this example, might not be preserved due to unfavourable meteorological conditions."

Extreme wildfires and disasters around the world: Lessons to be learned,10.1016/B978-0-12-815721-3.00002-3,Ribeiro L.M.,"In this chapter, the cases of the extreme wildfires and disasters that occurred in Portugal in 2013 (Picões and Caramulo) and in 2017 (Pedrogão Grande and Central Region), their fire environment, fire propagation, and impacts are described. The Portuguese experience is complemented with other cases that occurred in Greece, Italy, Australia, USA, and Canada, which are described following different fire management approaches. These cases put in evidence the complexity involved in managing these increasingly frequent extreme fire events."
Appraisal of the Sentinel-1 &amp; 2 use in a large-scale wildfire assessment: A case study from Portugal's fires of 2017,10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.10.004,Brown A.,"The recent launch of Sentinel missions offers a unique opportunity to assess the impacts of wildfires at higher spatial and spectral resolution provided by those Earth Observing (EO) systems. Herein, an assessment of the Sentinel-1 & 2 to map burnt areas has been conducted. Initially the use of Sentinel-2 solely was explored, and then in combination with Sentinel-1 and derived radiometric indices. As a case study, the large wildfire occurred in Pedrógão Grande, Portugal in 2017 was used. Burnt area estimates from the European Forest Fires Information System (EFFIS) were used as reference. Burnt area was delineated using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifiers, and two multi-index methods. Following this, burn severity was assessed using SVMs and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), again for both standalone Sentinel-2 data and in combination with Sentinel-1 and spectral indices. Soil erosion predictions were evaluated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The effect of the land cover derived from CORINE operational product was also evaluated across the burnt area and severity maps. SVMs produced the most accurate burnt area map, resulting a 94.8% overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient of 0.90. SVMs also achieved the highest accuracy in burn severity levels estimation, with an overall accuracy of 77.9% and a kappa of 0.710. From an algorithmic perspective, implementation of the techniques applied herein, is based on EO imagery analysis provided nowadays globally at no cost. It is also robust and adaptable, being potentially integrated with other high EO data available. All in all, our study contributes to the understanding of Mediterranean landscape dynamics and corroborates the usefulness of Sentinels data in wildfire studies."
Municipal clusters of bioenergy: A contribution to forest fire prevention,10.18055/Finis13717,Poggi F.,"After the shock that Portugal suffered with the forest fires at Pedrogão Grande (2017), inspiring critical reflections on the role and social responsibility of Geography is especially relevant to develop an adequate response framework for the protection of life, goods and natural resources. This article reflects on a cause -effect -solution relationship to be established for the prevention of forest fires that articulates the geography of energy with municipal planning. It is a critical reflection on the strategic role of the Municipal Master Plan and the possible contributions that the utilization and valorization of the forest biomass can make, with the view to developing municipal bioenergy clusters. Here, cleaning and collecting forest waste for the production of renewable energy emerge as an opportunity to link energy, forest and economic benefits toward an effective fire risk prevention led by municipal decision making."
